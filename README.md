### Hello!

I am [Daniel Miliate](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmiliate/), a Mechanical Engineering PhD graduate student in the [Martini Research Group](https://www.linkedin.com/company/martinitribos/posts/?feedView=all) at the University of California Merced. 

My work is primarily based in tribological applications for space. I use computational chemistry, machine learning and continuum meechanics in addition to experiments. Some of the computational work is stored here. 

### Feel free to reach out
I enjoy meeting new people with quick questions or deeper dive conversations.
